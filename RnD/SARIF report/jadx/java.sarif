This applies to various database query languages, including SQL and the Java Persistence Query Language.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nUsually, it is better to use a SQL prepared statement than to build a complete SQL query with string concatenation. A prepared statement can include a wildcard, written as a question mark (?), for each part of the SQL query that is expected to be filled in by a different value each time it is run. When the query is later executed, a value must be supplied for each wildcard in the query.\n\nIn the Java Persistence Query Language, it is better to use queries with parameters than to build a complete query with string concatenation. A Java Persistence query can include a parameter placeholder for each part of the query that is expected to be filled in by a different value when run. A parameter placeholder may be indicated by a colon (:) followed by a parameter name, or by a question mark (?) followed by an integer position. When the query is later executed, a value must be supplied for each parameter in the query, using the `setParameter` method. Specifying the query using the `@NamedQuery` annotation introduces an additional level of safety: the query must be a constant string literal, preventing construction by string concatenation, and the only way to fill in values for parts of the query is by setting positional parameters.\n\nIt is good practice to use prepared statements (in SQL) or query parameters (in the Java Persistence Query Language) for supplying parameter values to a query, whether or not any of the parameters are directly traceable to user input. Doing so avoids any need to worry about quoting and escaping.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the following example, the code runs a simple SQL query in two different ways.\n\nThe first way involves building a query, `query1`, by concatenating an environment variable with some string literals. The environment variable can include special characters, so this code allows for SQL injection attacks.\n\nThe second way, which shows good practice, involves building a query, `query2`, with a single string literal that includes a wildcard (`?`). The wildcard is then given a value by calling `setString`. This version is immune to injection attacks, because any special characters in the environment variable are not given any special treatment.\n\n\n```java\n{\n    // BAD: the category might have SQL special characters in it\n    String category = System.getenv(\"ITEM_CATEGORY\");\n    Statement statement = connection.createStatement();\n    String query1 = \"SELECT ITEM,PRICE FROM PRODUCT WHERE ITEM_CATEGORY='\"\n        + category + \"' ORDER BY PRICE\";\n    ResultSet results = statement.executeQuery(query1);\n}\n\n{\n    // GOOD: use a prepared query\n    String category = System.getenv(\"ITEM_CATEGORY\");\n    String query2 = \"SELECT ITEM,PRICE FROM PRODUCT WHERE ITEM_CATEGORY=? ORDER BY PRICE\";\n    PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement(query2);\n    statement.setString(1, category);\n    ResultSet results = statement.executeQuery();\n}\n```\n\n## Example\nThe following code shows several different ways to run a Java Persistence query.\n\nThe first example involves building a query, `query1`, by concatenating an environment variable with some string literals. Just like the SQL example, the environment variable can include special characters, so this code allows for Java Persistence query injection attacks.\n\nThe remaining examples demonstrate different methods for safely building a Java Persistence query with user-supplied values:\n\n1. `query2` uses a single string literal that includes a placeholder for a parameter, indicated by a colon (`:`) and parameter name (`category`).\n1. `query3` uses a single string literal that includes a placeholder for a parameter, indicated by a question mark (`?`) and position number (`1`).\n1. `namedQuery1` is defined using the `@NamedQuery` annotation, whose `query` attribute is a string literal that includes a placeholder for a parameter, indicated by a colon (`:`) and parameter name (`category`).\n1. `namedQuery2` is defined using the `@NamedQuery` annotation, whose `query` attribute includes a placeholder for a parameter, indicated by a question mark (`?`) and position number (`1`).\nThe parameter is then given a value by calling `setParameter`. These versions are immune to injection attacks, because any special characters in the environment variable or user-supplied value are not given any special treatment.\n\n\n```java\n{\n    // BAD: the category might have Java Persistence Query Language special characters in it\n    String category = System.getenv(\"ITEM_CATEGORY\");\n    Statement statement = connection.createStatement();\n    String query1 = \"SELECT p FROM Product p WHERE p.category LIKE '\"\n        + category + \"' ORDER BY p.price\";\n    Query q = entityManager.createQuery(query1);\n}\n\n{\n    // GOOD: use a named parameter and set its value\n    String category = System.getenv(\"ITEM_CATEGORY\");\n    String query2 = \"SELECT p FROM Product p WHERE p.category LIKE :category ORDER BY p.price\"\n    Query q = entityManager.createQuery(query2);\n    q.setParameter(\"category\", category);\n}\n\n{\n    // GOOD: use a positional parameter and set its value\n    String category = System.getenv(\"ITEM_CATEGORY\");\n    String query3 = \"SELECT p FROM Product p WHERE p.category LIKE ?1 ORDER BY p.price\"\n    Query q = entityManager.createQuery(query3);\n    q.setParameter(1, category);\n}\n\n{\n    // GOOD: use a named query with a named parameter and set its value\n    @NamedQuery(\n            name=\"lookupByCategory\",\n            query=\"SELECT p FROM Product p WHERE p.category LIKE :category ORDER BY p.price\")\n    private static class NQ {}\n    ...\n    String category = System.getenv(\"ITEM_CATEGORY\");\n    Query namedQuery1 = entityManager.createNamedQuery(\"lookupByCategory\");\n    namedQuery1.setParameter(\"category\", category);\n}\n\n{\n    // GOOD: use a named query with a positional parameter and set its value\n    @NamedQuery(\n            name=\"lookupByCategory\",\n            query=\"SELECT p FROM Product p WHERE p.category LIKE ?1 ORDER BY p.price\")\n    private static class NQ {}\n    ...\n    String category = System.getenv(\"ITEM_CATEGORY\");\n    Query namedQuery2 = entityManager.createNamedQuery(\"lookupByCategory\");\n    namedQuery2.setParameter(1, category);\n}\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [SQL Injection Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/SQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html).\n* SEI CERT Oracle Coding Standard for Java: [IDS00-J.

Such regular expressions can negatively affect performance, or even allow a malicious user to perform a Denial of Service (\"DoS\") attack by crafting an expensive input string for the regular expression to match.\n\nThe regular expression engine provided by Java uses a backtracking non-deterministic finite automata to implement regular expression matching. While this approach is space-efficient and allows supporting advanced features like capture groups, it is not time-efficient in general. The worst-case time complexity of such an automaton can be polynomial or even exponential, meaning that for strings of a certain shape, increasing the input length by ten characters may make the automaton about 1000 times slower.\n\nTypically, a regular expression is affected by this problem if it contains a repetition of the form `r*` or `r+` where the sub-expression `r` is ambiguous in the sense that it can match some string in multiple ways. More information about the precise circumstances can be found in the references.\n\nNote that Java versions 9 and above have some mitigations against ReDoS; however they aren't perfect and more complex regular expressions can still be affected by this problem.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nModify the regular expression to remove the ambiguity, or ensure that the strings matched with the regular expression are short enough that the time-complexity does not matter. Alternatively, an alternate regex library that guarantees linear time execution, such as Google's RE2J, may be used.\n\n\n## Example\nConsider this use of a regular expression, which removes all leading and trailing whitespace in a string:\n\n```java\n\nPattern.compile(\"^\\\\s+|\\\\s+$\").matcher(text).replaceAll(\"\") // BAD\n```\nThe sub-expression `\"\\\\s+$\"` will match the whitespace characters in `text` from left to right, but it can start matching anywhere within a whitespace sequence. This is problematic for strings that do **not** end with a whitespace character. Such a string will force the regular expression engine to process each whitespace sequence once per whitespace character in the sequence.\n\nThis ultimately means that the time cost of trimming a string is quadratic in the length of the string. So a string like `\"a b\"` will take milliseconds to process, but a similar string with a million spaces instead of just one will take several minutes.\n\nAvoid this problem by rewriting the regular expression to not contain the ambiguity about when to start matching whitespace sequences. For instance, by using a negative look-behind (`\"^\\\\s+|(?<!\\\\s)\\\\s+$\"`), or just by using the built-in trim method (`text.trim()`).\n\nNote that the sub-expression `\"^\\\\s+\"` is **not** problematic as the `^` anchor restricts when that sub-expression can start matching, and as the regular expression engine matches from left to right.\n\n\n## Example\nAs a similar, but slightly subtler problem, consider the regular expression that matches lines with numbers, possibly written using scientific notation:\n\n```java\n\n\"^0\\\\.\\\\d+E?\\\\d+$\"\" \n```\nThe problem with this regular expression is in the sub-expression `\\d+E?\\d+` because the second `\\d+` can start matching digits anywhere after the first match of the first `\\d+` if there is no `E` in the input string.\n\nThis is problematic for strings that do **not** end with a digit. Such a string will force the regular expression engine to process each digit sequence once per digit in the sequence, again leading to a quadratic time complexity.\n\nTo make the processing faster, the regular expression should be rewritten such that the two `\\d+` sub-expressions do not have overlapping matches: `\"^0\\\\.\\\\d+(E\\\\d+)?$\"`.\n\n\n## Example\nSometimes it is unclear how a regular expression can be rewritten to avoid the problem. In such cases, it often suffices to limit the length of the input string. For instance, the following regular expression is used to match numbers, and on some non-number inputs it can have quadratic time complexity:\n\n```java\n\nPattern.matches(\"^(\\\\+|-)?(\\\\d+|(\\\\d*\\\\.\\\\d*))?(E|e)?([-+])?(\\\\d+)?$\", str); \n```\nIt is not immediately obvious how to rewrite this regular expression to avoid the problem. However, you can mitigate performance issues by limiting the length to 1000 characters, which will always finish in a reasonable amount of time.\n\n```java\n\nif (str.length() > 1000) {\n    throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Input too long\");\n}\n\nPattern.matches(\"^(\\\\+|-)?(\\\\d+|(\\\\d*\\\\.\\\\d*))?(E|e)?([-+])?(\\\\d+)?$\", str); \n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [Regular expression Denial of Service - ReDoS](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS).\n* Wikipedia: [ReDoS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReDoS).\n* Wikipedia: [Time complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity).\n* James Kirrage, Asiri Rathnayake, Hayo Thielecke: [Static Analysis for Regular Expression Denial-of-Service Attack](http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~hxt/research/reg-exp-sec.pdf).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-1333](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-730](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/730.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-400](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html).\n",

This ensures that the user cannot insert characters which have a special meaning in regular expressions.\n\n\n```java\nimport java.util.regex.Pattern;\nimport javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet;\nimport javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;\n\npublic class RegexInjectionDemo extends HttpServlet {\n\n  public boolean badExample(javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest request) {\n    String regex = request.getParameter(\"regex\");\n    String input = request.getParameter(\"input\");\n\n    // BAD: Unsanitized user input is used to construct a regular expression\n    return input.matches(regex);\n  }\n\n  public boolean goodExample(javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest request) {\n    String regex = request.getParameter(\"regex\");\n    String input = request.getParameter(\"input\");\n\n    // GOOD: User input is sanitized before constructing the regex\n    return input.matches(Pattern.quote(regex));\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [Regular expression Denial of Service - ReDoS](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS).\n* Wikipedia: [ReDoS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReDoS).\n* Java API Specification: [Pattern.quote](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/regex/Pattern.html#quote(java.lang.String)).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-730](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/730.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-400](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html).\n"

A malicious application could provide the name of an arbitrary fragment, even one not designed to be externally accessible, and inject it into the activity. This can bypass access controls and expose the application to unintended effects.\n\nFragments are reusable parts of an Android application's user interface. Even though a fragment controls its own lifecycle and layout, and handles its input events, it cannot exist on its own: it must be hosted either by an activity or another fragment. This means that, normally, a fragment will be accessible by third-party applications (that is, exported) only if its hosting activity is itself exported.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nIn general, do not instantiate classes (including fragments) with user-provided names unless the name has been properly validated. Also, if an exported activity is extending the `PreferenceActivity` class, make sure that the `isValidFragment` method is overriden and only returns `true` when the provided `fragmentName` points to an intended fragment.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example shows two cases: in the first one, untrusted data is used to instantiate and add a fragment to an activity, while in the second one, a fragment is safely added with a static name.\n\n\n```java\npublic class MyActivity extends FragmentActivity {\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstance) {\n        try {\n            super.onCreate(savedInstance);\n            // BAD: Fragment instantiated from user input without validation\n            {\n                String fName = getIntent().getStringExtra(\"fragmentName\");\n                getFragmentManager().beginTransaction().replace(com.android.internal.R.id.prefs,\n                        Fragment.instantiate(this, fName, null)).commit();\n            }\n            // GOOD: Fragment instantiated statically\n            {\n                getFragmentManager().beginTransaction()\n                        .replace(com.android.internal.R.id.prefs, new MyFragment()).commit();\n            }\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n        }\n    }\n\n}\n\n```\nThe next example shows two activities that extend `PreferenceActivity`. The first activity overrides `isValidFragment`, but it wrongly returns `true` unconditionally. The second activity correctly overrides `isValidFragment` so that it only returns `true` when `fragmentName` is a trusted fragment name.\n\n\n```java\nclass UnsafeActivity extends PreferenceActivity {\n\n    @Override\n    protected boolean isValidFragment(String fragmentName) {\n        // BAD: any Fragment name can be provided.\n        return true;\n    }\n}\n\n\nclass SafeActivity extends PreferenceActivity {\n    @Override\n    protected boolean isValidFragment(String fragmentName) {\n        // Good: only trusted Fragment names are allowed.\n        return SafeFragment1.class.getName().equals(fragmentName)\n                || SafeFragment2.class.getName().equals(fragmentName)\n                || SafeFragment3.class.getName().equals(fragmentName);\n    }\n\n}\n\n\n```\n\n## References\n* Google Help: [How to fix Fragment Injection vulnerability](https://support.google.com/faqs/answer/7188427?hl=en).\n* IBM Security Systems: [Android collapses into Fragments](https://securityintelligence.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/android-collapses-into-fragments.pdf).\n* Android Developers: [Fragments](https://developer.android.com/guide/fragments)\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-470](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/470.html).\n",

            "text" : "# HTTP response splitting\nDirectly writing user input (for example, an HTTP request parameter) to an HTTP header can lead to an HTTP request-splitting or response-splitting vulnerability.\n\nHTTP response splitting can lead to vulnerabilities such as XSS and cache poisoning.\n\nHTTP request splitting can allow an attacker to inject an additional HTTP request into a client's outgoing socket connection. This can allow an attacker to perform an SSRF-like attack.\n\nIn the context of a servlet container, if the user input includes blank lines and the servlet container does not escape the blank lines, then a remote user can cause the response to turn into two separate responses. The remote user can then control one or more responses, which is also HTTP response splitting.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nGuard against HTTP header splitting in the same way as guarding against cross-site scripting. Before passing any data into HTTP headers, either check the data for special characters, or escape any special characters that are present.\n\nIf the code calls Netty API's directly, ensure that the `validateHeaders` parameter is set to `true`.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example shows the 'name' parameter being written to a cookie in two different ways. The first way writes it directly to the cookie, and thus is vulnerable to response-splitting attacks.

Ideally, follow these rules:\n\n* Do not allow more than a single \".\" character.\n* Do not allow directory separators such as \"/\" or \"\\\\\" (depending on the file system).\n* Do not rely on simply replacing problematic sequences such as \"../\". For example, after applying this filter to \".../...//\" the resulting string would still be \"../\".\n* Ideally use a whitelist of known good patterns.\n\n## Example\nIn this example, a file name is read from a `java.net.Socket` and then used to access a file in the user's home directory and send it back over the socket. However, a malicious user could enter a file name which contains special characters. For example, the string \"../../etc/passwd\" will result in the code reading the file located at \"/home/\\[user\\]/../../etc/passwd\", which is the system's password file. This file would then be sent back to the user, giving them access to all the system's passwords.\n\n\n```java\npublic void sendUserFile(Socket sock, String user) {\n\tBufferedReader filenameReader = new BufferedReader(\n\t\t\tnew InputStreamReader(sock.getInputStream(), \"UTF-8\"));\n\tString filename = filenameReader.readLine();\n\t// BAD: read from a file using a path controlled by the user\n\tBufferedReader fileReader = new BufferedReader(\n\t\t\tnew FileReader(\"/home/\" + user + \"/\" + filename));\n\tString fileLine = fileReader.readLine();\n\twhile(fileLine != null) {\n\t\tsock.getOutputStream().write(fileLine.getBytes());\n\t\tfileLine = fileReader.readLine();\n\t}\n}\n\npublic void sendUserFileFixed(Socket sock, String user) {\n\t// ...\n\t\n\t// GOOD: remove all dots and directory delimiters from the filename before using\n\tString filename = filenameReader.readLine().replaceAll(\"\\\\.\", \"\").replaceAll(\"/\", \"\");\n\tBufferedReader fileReader = new BufferedReader(\n\t\t\tnew FileReader(\"/home/\" + user + \"/\" + filename));\n\n\t// ...\n}\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [Path Traversal](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Path_Traversal).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-22](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-23](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/23.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-36](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/36.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-73](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/73.html).\n"

Depending on the implementation of ` SecureRandom`, if an attacker knows what time the code was run, they could predict the generated random number.\n\nIn the third example shown here, the random number generator is allowed to generate its own seed, which it will do in a secure way.\n\n\n```java\nSecureRandom prng = new SecureRandom();\nint randomData = 0;\n\n// BAD: Using a constant value as a seed for a random number generator means all numbers it generates are predictable.\nprng.setSeed(12345L);\nrandomData = prng.next(32);\n\n// BAD: System.currentTimeMillis() returns the system time which is predictable.\nprng.setSeed(System.currentTimeMillis());\nrandomData = prng.next(32);\n\n// GOOD: SecureRandom implementations seed themselves securely by default.\nprng = new SecureRandom();\nrandomData = prng.next(32);\n\n```\n\n## References\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-335](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/335.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-337](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/337.html).\n"

It uses a custom implementation of `JexlUberspect` that checks if callees are instances of allowed classes.\n\n\n```java\npublic void evaluate(Socket socket) throws IOException {\n  try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(\n        new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()))) {\n    \n    JexlUberspect sandbox = new JexlUberspectSandbox();\n    JexlEngine jexl = new JexlBuilder().uberspect(sandbox).create();\n      \n    String input = reader.readLine();\n    JexlExpression expression = jexl.createExpression(input);\n    JexlContext context = new MapContext();\n    expression.evaluate(context);\n  }\n\n  private static class JexlUberspectSandbox implements JexlUberspect {\n\n    private static final List<String> ALLOWED_CLASSES =\n              Arrays.asList(\"java.lang.Math\", \"java.util.Random\");\n\n    private final JexlUberspect uberspect = new JexlBuilder().create().getUberspect();\n\n    private void checkAccess(Object obj) {\n      if (!ALLOWED_CLASSES.contains(obj.getClass().getCanonicalName())) {\n        throw new AccessControlException(\"Not allowed\");\n      }\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public JexlMethod getMethod(Object obj, String method, Object... args) {\n      checkAccess(obj);\n      return uberspect.getMethod(obj, method, args);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public List<PropertyResolver> getResolvers(JexlOperator op, Object obj) {\n      checkAccess(obj);\n      return uberspect.getResolvers(op, obj);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void setClassLoader(ClassLoader loader) {\n      uberspect.setClassLoader(loader);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public int getVersion() {\n      return uberspect.getVersion();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public JexlMethod getConstructor(Object obj, Object... args) {\n      checkAccess(obj);\n      return uberspect.getConstructor(obj, args);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public JexlPropertyGet getPropertyGet(Object obj, Object identifier) {\n      checkAccess(obj);\n      return uberspect.getPropertyGet(obj, identifier);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public JexlPropertyGet getPropertyGet(List<PropertyResolver> resolvers, Object obj, Object identifier) {\n      checkAccess(obj);\n      return uberspect.getPropertyGet(resolvers, obj, identifier);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public JexlPropertySet getPropertySet(Object obj, Object identifier, Object arg) {\n      checkAccess(obj);\n      return uberspect.getPropertySet(obj, identifier, arg);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public JexlPropertySet getPropertySet(List<PropertyResolver> resolvers, Object obj, Object identifier, Object arg) {\n      checkAccess(obj);\n      return uberspect.getPropertySet(resolvers, obj, identifier, arg);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public Iterator<?> getIterator(Object obj) {\n      checkAccess(obj);\n      return uberspect.getIterator(obj);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public JexlArithmetic.Uberspect getArithmetic(JexlArithmetic arithmetic) {\n      return uberspect.getArithmetic(arithmetic);\n    } \n  }\n}\n```\n\n## References\n* Apache Commons JEXL: [Project page](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-jexl/).\n* Apache Commons JEXL documentation: [JEXL 2.1.1 API](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-jexl/javadocs/apidocs-2.1.1/).\n* Apache Commons JEXL documentation: [JEXL 3.1 API](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-jexl/apidocs/index.html).\n* OWASP: [Expression Language Injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Expression_Language_Injection).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-94](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/94.html).\n"

            "text" : "# Groovy Language injection\nApache Groovy is a powerful, optionally typed and dynamic language, with static-typing and static compilation capabilities. It integrates smoothly with any Java program, and immediately delivers to your application powerful features, including scripting capabilities, Domain-Specific Language authoring, runtime and compile-time meta-programming and functional programming. If a Groovy script is built using attacker-controlled data, and then evaluated, then it may allow the attacker to achieve RCE.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nIt is generally recommended to avoid using untrusted input in a Groovy evaluation. If this is not possible, use a sandbox solution. Developers must also take care that Groovy compile-time metaprogramming can also lead to RCE: it is possible to achieve RCE by compiling a Groovy script (see the article \"Abusing Meta Programming for Unauthenticated RCE!\" linked below). Groovy's `SecureASTCustomizer` allows securing source code by controlling what code constructs are permitted. This is typically done when using Groovy for its scripting or domain specific language (DSL) features. The fundamental problem is that Groovy is a dynamic language, yet `SecureASTCustomizer` works by looking at Groovy AST statically. This makes it very easy for an attacker to bypass many of the intended checks (see \\[Groovy SecureASTCustomizer is harmful\\](https://kohsuke.org/2012/04/27/groovy-secureastcustomizer-is-harmful/)). Therefore, besides `SecureASTCustomizer`, runtime checks are also necessary before calling Groovy methods (see \\[Improved sandboxing of Groovy scripts\\](https://melix.github.io/blog/2015/03/sandboxing.html)). It is also possible to use a block-list method, excluding unwanted classes from being loaded by the JVM. This method is not always recommended, because block-lists can be bypassed by unexpected values.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example uses untrusted data to evaluate a Groovy script.\n\n\n```java\npublic class GroovyInjection {\n    void injectionViaClassLoader(HttpServletRequest request) {    \n        String script = request.getParameter(\"script\");\n        final GroovyClassLoader classLoader = new GroovyClassLoader();\n        Class groovy = classLoader.parseClass(script);\n        GroovyObject groovyObj = (GroovyObject) groovy.newInstance();\n    }\n\n    void injectionViaEval(HttpServletRequest request) {\n        String script = request.getParameter(\"script\");\n        Eval.me(script);\n    }\n\n    void injectionViaGroovyShell(HttpServletRequest request) {\n        GroovyShell shell = new GroovyShell();\n        String script = request.getParameter(\"script\");\n        shell.evaluate(script);\n    }\n\n    void injectionViaGroovyShellGroovyCodeSource(HttpServletRequest request) {\n        GroovyShell shell = new GroovyShell();\n        String script = request.getParameter(\"script\");\n        GroovyCodeSource gcs = new GroovyCodeSource(script, \"test\", \"Test\");\n        shell.evaluate(gcs);\n    }\n}\n\n\n```\nThe following example uses classloader block-list approach to exclude loading dangerous classes.\n\n\n```java\npublic class SandboxGroovyClassLoader extends ClassLoader {\n    public SandboxGroovyClassLoader(ClassLoader parent) {\n        super(parent);\n    }\n\n    /* override `loadClass` here to prevent loading sensitive classes, such as `java.lang.Runtime`, `java.lang.ProcessBuilder`, `java.lang.System`, etc.  */\n    /* Note we must also block `groovy.transform.ASTTest`, `groovy.lang.GrabConfig` and `org.buildobjects.process.ProcBuilder` to prevent compile-time RCE. */\n\n    static void runWithSandboxGroovyClassLoader() throws Exception {\n        // GOOD: route all class-loading via sand-boxing classloader.\n        SandboxGroovyClassLoader classLoader = new GroovyClassLoader(new SandboxGroovyClassLoader());\n        \n        Class<?> scriptClass = classLoader.parseClass(untrusted.getQueryString());\n        Object scriptInstance = scriptClass.newInstance();\n        Object result = scriptClass.getDeclaredMethod(\"bar\", new Class[]{}).invoke(scriptInstance, new Object[]{});\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## References\n* Orange Tsai: [Abusing Meta Programming for Unauthenticated RCE!](https://blog.orange.tw/2019/02/abusing-meta-programming-for-unauthenticated-rce.html).\n* Cédric Champeau: [Improved sandboxing of Groovy scripts](https://melix.github.io/blog/2015/03/sandboxing.html).\n* Kohsuke Kawaguchi: [Groovy SecureASTCustomizer is harmful](https://kohsuke.org/2012/04/27/groovy-secureastcustomizer-is-harmful/).\n* Welk1n: [Groovy Injection payloads](https://github.com/welk1n/exploiting-groovy-in-Java/).\n* Charles Chan: [Secure Groovy Script Execution in a Sandbox](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/secure-groovy-script-execution-in-a-sandbox-ea39f80ee87/).\n* Eugene: [Scripting and sandboxing in a JVM environment](https://stringconcat.com/en/scripting-and-sandboxing/).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-94](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/94.html).\n",

If possible build the LDAP query using framework helper methods, for example from Spring's `LdapQueryBuilder` and `LdapNameBuilder`, instead of string concatenation. Alternatively, escape user input using an appropriate LDAP encoding method, for example: `encodeForLDAP` or `encodeForDN` from OWASP ESAPI, `LdapEncoder.filterEncode` or `LdapEncoder.nameEncode` from Spring LDAP, or `Filter.encodeValue` from UnboundID library.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the following examples, the code accepts an \"organization name\" and a \"username\" from the user, which it uses to query LDAP.\n\nThe first example concatenates the unvalidated and unencoded user input directly into both the DN (Distinguished Name) and the search filter used for the LDAP query. A malicious user could provide special characters to change the meaning of these queries, and search for a completely different set of values. The LDAP query is executed using Java JNDI API.\n\nThe second example uses the OWASP ESAPI library to encode the user values before they are included in the DN and search filters. This ensures the meaning of the query cannot be changed by a malicious user.\n\n\n```java\nimport javax.naming.directory.DirContext;\nimport org.owasp.esapi.Encoder;\nimport org.owasp.esapi.reference.DefaultEncoder;\n\npublic void ldapQueryBad(HttpServletRequest request, DirContext ctx) throws NamingException {\n  String organizationName = request.getParameter(\"organization_name\");\n  String username = request.getParameter(\"username\");\n\n  // BAD: User input used in DN (Distinguished Name) without encoding\n  String dn = \"OU=People,O=\" + organizationName;\n\n  // BAD: User input used in search filter without encoding\n  String filter = \"username=\" + userName;\n\n  ctx.search(dn, filter, new SearchControls());\n}\n\npublic void ldapQueryGood(HttpServletRequest request, DirContext ctx) throws NamingException {\n  String organizationName = request.getParameter(\"organization_name\");\n  String username = request.getParameter(\"username\");\n\n  // ESAPI encoder\n  Encoder encoder = DefaultEncoder.getInstance();\n\n  // GOOD: Organization name is encoded before being used in DN\n  String safeOrganizationName = encoder.encodeForDN(organizationName);\n  String safeDn = \"OU=People,O=\" + safeOrganizationName;\n\n  // GOOD: User input is encoded before being used in search filter\n  String safeUsername = encoder.encodeForLDAP(username);\n  String safeFilter = \"username=\" + safeUsername;\n  \n  ctx.search(safeDn, safeFilter, new SearchControls());\n}\n```\nThe third example uses Spring `LdapQueryBuilder` to build an LDAP query. In addition to simplifying the building of complex search parameters, it also provides proper escaping of any unsafe characters in search filters. The DN is built using `LdapNameBuilder`, which also provides proper escaping.\n\n\n```java\nimport static org.springframework.ldap.query.LdapQueryBuilder.query;\nimport org.springframework.ldap.support.LdapNameBuilder;\n\npublic void ldapQueryGood(@RequestParam String organizationName, @RequestParam String username) {\n  // GOOD: Organization name is encoded before being used in DN\n  String safeDn = LdapNameBuilder.newInstance()\n    .add(\"O\", organizationName)\n    .add(\"OU=People\")\n    .build().toString();\n\n  // GOOD: User input is encoded before being used in search filter\n  LdapQuery query = query()\n    .base(safeDn)\n    .where(\"username\").is(username);\n\n  ldapTemplate.search(query, new AttributeCheckAttributesMapper());\n}\n```\nThe fourth example uses `UnboundID` classes, `Filter` and `DN`, to construct a safe filter and base DN.\n\n\n```java\nimport com.unboundid.ldap.sdk.LDAPConnection;\nimport com.unboundid.ldap.sdk.DN;\nimport com.unboundid.ldap.sdk.RDN;\nimport com.unboundid.ldap.sdk.Filter;\n\npublic void ldapQueryGood(HttpServletRequest request, LDAPConnection c) {\n  String organizationName = request.getParameter(\"organization_name\");\n  String username = request.getParameter(\"username\");\n\n  // GOOD: Organization name is encoded before being used in DN\n  DN safeDn = new DN(new RDN(\"OU\", \"People\"), new RDN(\"O\", organizationName));\n\n  // GOOD: User input is encoded before being used in search filter\n  Filter safeFilter = Filter.createEqualityFilter(\"username\", username);\n  \n  c.search(safeDn.toString(), SearchScope.ONE, safeFilter);\n}\n```\nThe fifth example shows how to build a safe filter and DN using the Apache LDAP API.\n\n\n```java\nimport org.apache.directory.ldap.client.api.LdapConnection;\nimport org.apache.directory.api.ldap.model.name.Dn;\nimport org.apache.directory.api.ldap.model.name.Rdn;\nimport org.apache.directory.api.ldap.model.message.SearchRequest;\nimport org.apache.directory.api.ldap.model.message.SearchRequestImpl;\nimport static org.apache.directory.ldap.client.api.search.FilterBuilder.equal;\n\npublic void ldapQueryGood(HttpServletRequest request, LdapConnection c) {\n  String organizationName = request.getParameter(\"organization_name\");\n  String username = request.getParameter(\"username\");\n\n  // GOOD: Organization name is encoded before being used in DN\n  Dn safeDn = new Dn(new Rdn(\"OU\", \"People\"), new Rdn(\"O\", organizationName));\n\n  // GOOD: User input is encoded before being used in search filter\n  String safeFilter = equal(\"username\", username);\n  \n  SearchRequest searchRequest = new SearchRequestImpl();\n  searchRequest.setBase(safeDn);\n  searchRequest.setFilter(safeFilter);\n  c.search(searchRequest);\n}\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [LDAP Injection Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/LDAP_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html).\n* OWASP ESAPI: [OWASP ESAPI](https://owasp.org/www-project-enterprise-security-api/).\n* Spring LdapQueryBuilder doc: [LdapQueryBuilder](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ldap/docs/current/apidocs/org/springframework/ldap/query/LdapQueryBuilder.html).\n* Spring LdapNameBuilder doc: [LdapNameBuilder](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ldap/docs/current/apidocs/org/springframework/ldap/support/LdapNameBuilder.html).\n* UnboundID: [Understanding and Defending Against LDAP Injection Attacks](https://ldap.com/2018/05/04/understanding-and-defending-against-ldap-injection-attacks/).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-90](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/90.html).\n",

The authority part (the first path segment) of the URI, passed as parameter to the `ContentResolver`, determines which content provider is contacted for the operation. Specific operations that act on files also support the `file://` scheme, in which case the local filesystem is queried instead. If an external component, like a malicious or compromised application, controls the URI for a `ContentResolver` operation, it can trick the vulnerable application into accessing its own private files or non-exported content providers. The attacking application might be able to get access to the file by forcing it to be copied to a public directory, like external storage, or tamper with the contents by making the application overwrite the file with unexpected data.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nIf possible, avoid using externally-provided data to determine the URI for a `ContentResolver` to use. If that is not an option, validate that the incoming URI can only reference trusted components, like an allow list of content providers and/or applications, or alternatively make sure that the URI does not reference private directories like `/data/`.\n\n\n## Example\nThis example shows three ways of opening a file using a `ContentResolver`. In the first case, externally-provided data from an intent is used directly in the file-reading operation. This allows an attacker to provide a URI of the form `/data/data/(vulnerable app package)/(private file)` to trick the application into reading it and copying it to the external storage.

As well, a user who cannot gain full control of an input might influence it enough to cause the SQL query to fail to run.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nUsually, it is better to use a SQL prepared statement than to build a complete SQL query with string concatenation.

A Java Persistence query can include a parameter placeholder for each part of the query that is expected to be filled in by a different value when run. A parameter placeholder may be indicated by a colon (:) followed by a parameter name, or by a question mark (?) followed by an integer position. When the query is later executed, a value must be supplied for each parameter in the query, using the `setParameter` method.

Doing so avoids any need to worry about quoting and escaping.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the following example, the code runs a simple SQL query in two different ways.\n\nThe first way involves building a query, `query1`, by concatenating the result of `getCategory` with some string literals. The result of `getCategory` can include special characters, or it might be refactored later so that it may return something that contains special characters.\n\nThe second way, which shows good practice, involves building a query, `query2`, with a single string literal that includes a wildcard (`?`). The wildcard is then given a value by calling `setString`. This version is immune to injection attacks, because any special characters in the result of `getCategory` are not given any special treatment.\n\n\n```java\n{\n    // BAD: the category might have SQL special characters in it\n    String category = getCategory();\n    Statement statement = connection.createStatement();\n    String query1 = \"SELECT ITEM,PRICE FROM PRODUCT WHERE ITEM_CATEGORY='\"\n        + category + \"' ORDER BY PRICE\";\n    ResultSet results = statement.executeQuery(query1);\n}\n\n{\n    // GOOD: use a prepared query\n    String category = getCategory();\n    String query2 = \"SELECT ITEM,PRICE FROM PRODUCT WHERE ITEM_CATEGORY=?

Because `MAXGET` is larger than `Short.MAX_VALUE`, the loop condition is always `true`, so the loop never terminates.\n\nThis problem is avoided in the 'GOOD' case because `bytesReceived2` is a `long`, which is as wide as the type of `MAXGET`.\n\n\n```java\nclass Test {\n\tpublic static void main(String[] args) {\n\t\t\n\t\t{\t\t\n\t\t\tint BIGNUM = Integer.MAX_VALUE;\n\t\t\tlong MAXGET = Short.MAX_VALUE + 1;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tchar[] buf = new char[BIGNUM];\n\n\t\t\tshort bytesReceived = 0;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t// BAD: 'bytesReceived' is compared with a value of wider type.\n\t\t\t// 'bytesReceived' overflows before reaching MAXGET,\n\t\t\t// causing an infinite loop.\n\t\t\twhile (bytesReceived < MAXGET) {\n\t\t\t\tbytesReceived += getFromInput(buf, bytesReceived);\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t\t\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tlong bytesReceived2 = 0;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t// GOOD: 'bytesReceived2' has a type at least as wide as MAXGET.\n\t\t\twhile (bytesReceived2 < MAXGET) {\n\t\t\t\tbytesReceived2 += getFromInput(buf, bytesReceived2);\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t\t\n\t}\n\t\n\tpublic static int getFromInput(char[] buf, short pos) {\n\t\t// write to buf\n\t\t// ...\n\t\treturn 1;\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n## References\n* SEI CERT Oracle Coding Standard for Java: [NUM00-J.

            "text" : "# Android missing certificate pinning\nCertificate pinning is the practice of only trusting a specific set of SSL certificates, rather than those that the device trusts by default. In Android applications, it is reccomended to use certificate pinning when communicating over the network, in order to minimize the risk of machine-in-the-middle attacks from a compromised CA.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nThe easiest way to implement certificate pinning is to declare your pins in a `network-security-config` XML file.

            "markdown" : "# Android missing certificate pinning\nCertificate pinning is the practice of only trusting a specific set of SSL certificates, rather than those that the device trusts by default.
